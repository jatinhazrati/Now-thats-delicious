# Now That Delicious

This is a food store locator built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB & friends...
Here's the running project: https://nowthatdelicious.herokuapp.com/ (It is beign hosted on a free heroku site so initial load make take some time)

## What is this?

Just you wait folks!

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

| Name          | Email (login)          | Password |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| Jatin Hazrati | jatinhazrati@gmail.com | jatin123 |
